# JavaScript Loose Typing and Null Handling

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to loose typing and how it can affect null value handling. The `bug.js` file shows an example where a function attempts to handle null values, but due to JavaScript's loose typing, unexpected behavior occurs when comparing null with other data types.

The solution in `bugSolution.js` uses strict equality (`===`) and explicit type checking to resolve the issue. This ensures that the function behaves as intended for different input types.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` in your preferred JavaScript environment.
3. Execute the code and observe the differences in output and behavior.
